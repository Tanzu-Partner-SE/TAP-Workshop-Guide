# TAP Workshop Guides 

Before or after attending each TAP workshop, participants may use the guide here 
to preview or review the content of the workshop. Previewing a workshop guide here 
will make the performing of the tasks in the workshop more quickly and smoothly. 
Reviewing a workshop guide will reinforce the technologies just learned at the workshop.



The TAP guides here may be used as a reference that is available anytime, 
while the workshop content is only available during the actual workshop.
